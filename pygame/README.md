# Pygame Arcade Games

You'll need to have the pygame python package installed to run these.  

### pong.py

Two player game of virtual "ping pong".  Player on the right uses up and down,
player on the left users W and S.  ESC to quit. 

### breakout.py

Break all the bricks with the ball.  Use the mouse to control your paddle and
don't let it go past you.  ESC to quit.

### lunar_lander.py

Land your ship on the flat, red platform.  Use left and right to maneuver and
up to thrust.  Don't run out of fuel!

### asteroids.py

Classic arcade game Asteroids. Use left and right to turn, up to thrust, ctrl
to shoot, ESC to quit. Shoot all the asteroids.

### asteroids2.py

Same as asteroids.py but using sprites.

### miner2525.py

Idea for a future game.  Same concept as Asteroids but a larger game map where
the player remains centered in the viewport.  Eventually have this turn into a
space exploration adventure game.
