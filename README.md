# Games
Very simple games I've made for my own personal enjoyment.  Mostly to (re)learn python, ruby.  And for fun. 

## Pygame
Simple classic arcade games remade in pygame.

## Text Adventures
Playing around with old school text adventures (e.g. Zork). Tried to make it as a generic "engine"
that can take a game data file in JSON format.  The idea is to have multiple games that work
with a single main.py


More to come...
